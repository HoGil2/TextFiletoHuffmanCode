# TextFiletoHuffmanCode

It's my university assignment about HuffmanCode. 
It's not possible a Huffman compression. 
Just only check the HuffmanCode for Alphabet('A' ~ 'z'), if it performed Huffman compression that textfile.

I make this project using "visual studio 2015". 
So It's couldn't work any other version or utility. Sorry for my insufficent english and coding skils.
